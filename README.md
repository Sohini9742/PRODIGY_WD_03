# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the objective of being the first to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can click on the grid to place their marks (X or O).
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player wins or if the game results in a draw.
- **Restart Option**: Players can restart the game at any time to play again.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the game interface and elements.
- **CSS**: Used to style the game, including the grid layout, colors, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic, player interactions, and win/draw conditions.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. **Make Your Move**: Click on any empty square in the grid to place your mark (X or O).
3. **Winning**: The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. **Draw**: If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
5. **Restart**: Click the "Restart" button to reset the game and play again.
